## Building Athanor-Server

1. Move to the directory where you placed the Athanor-Server product. 
Assuming it is in the home directory, you should see a build.sbt file containing instructions
on how the build is done:

        cd ~/athanor-server

2. Compile the product.

     The first compile may be slow as dependencies have to be fetched and placed
     in the ~/.ivy2 directory.

         sbt compile

     The following compile warnings seem to be safe to ignore, but ensure the
     last compile ends with [SUCCESS] :

         [warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
         [warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
