# Athanor-Server properties file

# The athanor-server code reads these values 
# from athanor-server.properties file which has to reside in 
# the classpath.

# *** NOTE TO USERS **********************************************
#
# Do not modify the shipped sample file. 
# Copy the file to a file called athanor-server.properties
# and modify your copy.

# *** NOTE TO DEVELOPERS *****************************************

# Current tests are dependent on the values in the sample file.
# Modify and rerun tests if you need to modify the sample file.

# grammar local path is hardcoded by default to
# HOME/athanor/grammar where HOME is the home path
# directory of the user that is starting the athanor-server.
# This default assumes athanor is installed in the home directory
# and the grammar directory is one level beneath. 
# If a value is specified here, it will overwrite the hardcoded
# default value, but can be overwritten by the ATHANOR_SERVER_LOCAL_GRAMMAR_PATH
# environment value.

# If a value is specified here, it overrides the default value
# but can be overwritten by by the ATHANOR_SERVER_DOCKER_GRAMMAR_PATH
# environment value.
